Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows multiple people to contirbute to a project at a time, and allows for optimized version control, making it easy to see when chnages are made and by whom, as well as the ability to roll back code to prior versions.
It also allows for sharing of an implmentation in a straightforward way.
